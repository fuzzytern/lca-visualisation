## LCA visualisation

This application features an interactive catalog of products for which Life Cycle Assesment data exists.

It is intended to:

* people willing to chose what they buy with care for other people and the environement
* brands willing to demonstrate their ability to make products with practices that respect people and the environment.

## Data available

Product data (Description, Parts list, Environmental Profile and Labels) can be added by any brand/retailer.

## Visualisation

## How do people get involved?

People are invited to have their say and show dissent when appropriate. They can do it in different ways:

* Commenting on product descriptions
* Voting on other people's comments
* Evaluating Environemental Profiles

## How do I know whether I should trust the data for a product?

Reading other people's reactions, evaluations and company's updates can help having a better idea on how accurate the data might be. Also, label claims are always verified by our team.
Anyone can report any abuse or erroneous information that a business would provide.

## As a business, why would I want to upload LCA data of my products?

* The more transparent and careful you are, the more praise you will get from your customers
* The large community of responsible consumers will provide you with instant feedback that will help you identify shortcomings in the design of your product, your processes, your communication materials or others.
